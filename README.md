## Coding Train
These codes are, loosely, based on the youtuber. He programs simple and practical programming challenges and I try and replicate the challenges, mostly using my own game engine. There are also other programs that I've tried out there as well. These codes include (in order):
##### Beesweeper (Minesweeper)
##### Binary Tree visualization
##### Diffusion-Limited Aggregation
##### Evolutionary Steering Behaviors
##### Visualized Flowfield
##### Forward Kinematics
##### Gravitational Physics (Gravity)
##### Hexagonal Grid
##### Inverse Kinematics
##### Mandelbrot Set
##### Maze Generation and Solving
##### Metaballs (Just try it)
##### Open Simplex Noise (Perlin Noise)
##### Rocket Propulsion in Space using Gravity Physics
##### Poisson Disc Sampling
##### Evolutionary Smart Rockets
##### Sound Visualization
##### Sudoku
##### Traveling Salesperson Algorithm
##### Genetic Algorithm of the Traveling Salesperson Algorithm

## Game Base
This is the code for the Java game engine that I created.
