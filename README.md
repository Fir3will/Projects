## Coding Train
These codes are, loosely, based on the youtuber. He programs simple and practical programming challenges and I try and replicate the challenges, mostly using my own game engine. There are also other programs that I've tried out there as well. These codes include (in order):  
_[Beesweeper (Minesweeper)](../blob/master/Coding%20Train%20src/main/beesweeper)_  
_[Binary Tree visualization](../blob/master/Coding%20Train%20src/main/binarytree)_  
_[Diffusion-Limited Aggregation](../blob/master/Coding%20Train%20src/main/diffusionlimitedaggregation)_  
_[Evolutionary Steering Behaviors](../blob/master/Coding%20Train%20src/main/evolutionarysb)_  
_[Visualized Flowfield](../blob/master/Coding%20Train%20src/main/flowfield)_  
_[Forward Kinematics](../blob/master/Coding%20Train%20src/main/forwardkinematics)_  
_[Gravitational Physics (Gravity)](../blob/master/Coding%20Train%20src/main/gravity)_  
_[Hexagonal Grid](../blob/master/Coding%20Train%20src/main/hexgrid)_  
_[Inverse Kinematics](../blob/master/Coding%20Train%20src/main/inversekinematics)_  
_[Mandelbrot Set](../blob/master/Coding%20Train%20src/main/mandelbrot)_  
_[Maze Generation and Solving](../blob/master/Coding%20Train%20src/main/maze)_  
_[Metaballs (Just try it)](../blob/master/Coding%20Train%20src/main/metaballs)_  
_[Open Simplex Noise (Perlin Noise)](../blob/master/Coding%20Train%20src/main/noise)_  
_[Rocket Propulsion in Space using Gravity Physics](../blob/master/Coding%20Train%20src/main/planetjumper)_  
_[Poisson Disc Sampling](../blob/master/Coding%20Train%20src/main/poissonds)_  
_[Evolutionary Smart Rockets](../blob/master/Coding%20Train%20src/main/smartrockets)_  
_[Sound Visualization](../blob/master/Coding%20Train%20src/main/sound)_  
_[Sudoku](../blob/master/Coding%20Train%20src/main/sound)_  
_[Traveling Salesperson Algorithm](../blob/master/Coding%20Train%20src/main/travelingsalesperson)_  
_[Genetic Algorithm of the Traveling Salesperson Algorithm](../blob/master/Coding%20Train%20src/main/tsp_ga)_  

## Game Base
This is the code for the Java game engine that I created.
